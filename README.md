# Bucket List Back End API
This is the back-end repository for the bucketlist project. This website allows
users to view their bucket list, where they can add, update, and delete items.

## How it works
As a user, one can create, read, update and delete bucketlist items. This tool is
useful when user need a way to manage their life's lists of things to accomplish.

## Planning, process, and problem-solving strategies
    In future iterations, we would like to add some animation, especially in the
    bucket list title. Ideally, we'd also spend more time on styling as well; we
    used Bootstrap templates, and customized them just enough for MVP.

## Routes and Methods
    '/sign-up' --> router.post()
    '/sign-in' --> router.post()
    '/sign-out' --> router.delete()
    '/change-password' --> router.patch()
    '/list-items' --> router.get(), router.post()
    '/list-items/:id' --> router.get(), router.patch(), router.delete()
    '/account' --> router.get(), router.post()
    '/account/:id' --> router.get(), router.patch(), router.delete()
